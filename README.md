# Hi, I'm Stephen 

I’m a Mechatronics Engineer based in Vancouver, BC, with a background in new product development and automated manufacturing equipment. Over the past 7+ years I’ve worked across a mix of projects, often in roles where there’s no single right answer and you have to figure things out as you go. That’s the part of engineering I’ve always liked the most.

These days I’ve been spending time building software — web apps, data tools, and experiments with AI — especially where they overlap with real engineering problems. A lot of what I build starts with “wouldn’t it be useful if…” and then I see how far I can take it.

## What I’ve been working with

- **Code:** TypeScript, Python, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Data & APIs:** PostgreSQL, Supabase, Prisma, GraphQL
- **AI & Analysis:** OpenAI API, Pandas, FastAPI, data visualisation tools
- **Other tools:** Git, Vercel, Node.js, MATLAB

## A few projects

- **Transformer Dashboard** – Real-time temperature tracking and visualisation for electrical utility equipment
- **Oil Expansion Calculator** – Predicts transformer oil level changes under different temperatures
- **Ski DIN Calculator** – Calculates ski binding settings to ISO 11088
- **MTB Tire Pressure Estimator** – Helps riders tune their tyre pressure for conditions
- **Data Pipeline Experiments** – Prototypes for automating reports and analysis

## Right now

I’m spending more time on AI-powered data processing, and on building full-stack apps that solve specific, real-world problems. Some of these are linked to my day-to-day engineering work, others are just things I’ve wanted to try for fun.
